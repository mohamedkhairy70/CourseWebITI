            <h2>About me: </h2>
            <p style="width: 70%;">I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.
                There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.
                I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream;
                I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning,
                I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face,
                I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank
                mind,
                I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in
                spring,
                rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I
                like to be alone,
                I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the
                beautiful west lake
                in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like
                good books
                and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
